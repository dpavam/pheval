Many algorithms are evaluated using simulations, which may fail to capture real-world scenarios. This gap presents a number of problems: it is difficult to optimize algorithms if we do not know which choices lead to better results; performance may be sensitive to factors that are subject to change, such as ontology structure or annotation completeness.

The plugin goal is to be flexible through custom runner implementations. This plugin development enhances the PhEval functionality. You can build one quickly using this step-by-step process. All custom Runners implementations must implement all PhevalRunner methods Bases: ABC PhEvalRunner Class Source code in src/pheval/runners/runner.py 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 @dataclass class PhEvalRunner ( ABC ): \"\"\"PhEvalRunner Class\"\"\" inputdir : click .

Path @abstractmethod def prepare ( self ) -> str : \"\"\"prepare\"\"\" @abstractmethod def run ( self ): \"\"\"run\"\"\" @abstractmethod def post_process ( self ): \"\"\"post_process\"\"\" Step-by-Step Plugin Development Process The plugin structure is derived from a cookiecutter template, Sphintoxetry-cookiecutter , and it uses Sphinx , tox and poetry as core dependencies. This allows PhEval extensibility to be standardized in terms of documentation and dependency management. 1. Sphintoxetry-cookiecutter scaffold First, install the cruft package. Cruft enables keeping projects up-to-date with future updates made to this original template. Install cruft from pip pip install cruft Next, create a project using the sphintoxetry-cookiecutter template. cruft create https://github.com/hrshdhgd/sphintoxetry-cookiecutter 2. Further setup Install poetry if you haven't already. pip install poetry Install dependencies poetry install Add PhEval dependency poetry add pheval Run tox to see if the setup works poetry run tox 3. Implement PhEval Custom Runner The runner name is arbitrary and custom Runner name was chose by demonstrative purposes Create a runner file inside the plugin project, e.g: \"\"\"Custom Pheval Runner.\"\"\" from dataclasses import dataclass import click from pheval.runners.runner import PhEvalRunner @dataclass class CustomPhevalRunner ( PhEvalRunner ): \"\"\"CustomPhevalRunner Class.\"\"\" inputdir : click .

Add PhEval Plugins section into the pyproject.toml file [tool.poetry.plugins.\"pheval.plugins\"] customrunner = \"pheval_plugin_example.runner:CustomPhevalRunner\" Replace the value above with the path to your custom runner plugin 5. Test it. To update your custom pheval runner implementation, you must first install the package poetry install Now you have to be able to run PhEval passing your custom runner as parameter. e.g pheval run -i input.txt -t './test' -r 'customphevalrunner' -o out.txt The -r parameter stands for your plugin runner class name and it must be entirely lowercase.
